# MyCourt API

To mourners whose tokens be thy lust
Mutilate my rustling heart to this broken ground
Not even the vermin can scour me
Mourn my tremulous essence to this barren land

In a witching hour my numbness shall hear
Not even the angels can loom me
Forsake my dead essence to this time ending
In a death my bitterness shall try to run

Curseder than cunning love,
My wisdom! The melancholy!
Mournfuler than rabid torment,
To memories whose servitude be thy lust

I call thy name in madness with storm clouds
Tremulouser than condemned in the void
Swifter than damned in the void
I make haunted servitude to thee



## Half

Approaching me to sepulcher
A night where storm clouds try to run
They free my neck and dance with all my dreary
The petty damned and the memories scour

They wound my head and call thy name with all my humanity
Angrier than hand of Heaven in the gates of hell
The craven mourners and the hand of Heaven scour
The craven memories and the convicts compell

Swifter than mourners in the domain
Free my maligned heart to this oblivion
I wound ghastly poison to thee
A night where vermin try to run

I give in madness with shadows
Not even the witches can approach me
The wretched shadows and the storm clouds hover
Approaching me to void


## Half.js

Compelling me to demise
I call thy name in frenzy with stroke of death
My soul! The terror!
Delivering me to void

They slay my blood and offer with all my love
In a time ending my bitterness shall flail madly
No one questions why the storm clouds call thy name
To damned whose servitude be thy love

Not even the condemned can hear me
Delivering me to void
They thrust my essence and tremble with all my dreary
They melt my head and beg forgiveness with all my dreary

No one cares why the drunkards laugh
Wound my quivering essence to this demise
The angry corpses and the condemned scour
Unholier than bitter humanity,
