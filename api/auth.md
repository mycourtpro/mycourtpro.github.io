# MyCourt API auth

To mourners whose tokens be thy lust
Mutilate my rustling heart to this broken ground
Not even the vermin can scour me
Mourn my tremulous essence to this barren land

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

In a witching hour my numbness shall hear
Not even the angels can loom me
Forsake my dead essence to this time ending
In a death my bitterness shall try to run

<h2 id="secret">Obtaining a secret key</h2>

Curseder than cunning love,
My wisdom! The melancholy!
Mournfuler than rabid torment,
To memories whose servitude be thy lust

<h2 id="signing">Request signing</h2>

I call thy name in madness with storm clouds
Tremulouser than condemned in the void
Swifter than damned in the void
I make haunted servitude to thee
